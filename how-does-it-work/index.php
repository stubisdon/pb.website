          <p>Ok, so here is how it usually works: I.Say Hi! We made it really easy to start a conversation with us. You can either send us a text through Chat Window, leave your contacts in a Contact Form, or Give us a Call for an immediate response. That’s it! The most important step is made. It’s now for us to take the steering wheel.II.   Let’s talk about your business Then, we schedule a Discovery Call and talk about what you’re working on. Our goal is to get the idea about your mission, a set of problems you’re solving and how you make it possible. We also take notes on your vision of the final result, but don’t worry if you haven’t defined it yet! We’re here to help and suggest what will be the best.Most people like to schedule a meeting in-person to discuss such things, and we love meeting new people! But we also had a number of projects completed solely over the phone or text-messaging. It’s all about the exchange of important information, not about the size of your office for us, so we totally understand.III.  Our vision Right after we got an idea of what your business is about, we team up and start drawing out how we can create a valuable asset that’ll help your business grow. We think about what it’ll be and how to make it. The vision breaks down into two parts: Creative part and Production part. Creative Part is all about vision of the final result: how long, loud and colorful it would be. Some people in the biz call it a Director’s Treatment. Production Part is about how we can make it possible. If you think of budget spreadsheets, timelines, team members – you think right. It helps us plan everything accordingly, and it definitely helps you understand what the process consists of. IV.  Work In ProgressWhen the vision is all drawn out and we get you on the same page with us, it’s time to start making it real! What we also noticed is the level of involvement for different customers – some like to creatively contribute to the final product and help us navigate through the field of business they are in, and others like to sit back and completely trust the driver. In both cases we are the Driver the matter of trust to the driver is the main thing. If you want us to keep you informed on each turn we’re taking - no worries, we got you. What we actually mean is the frequency, and type of communication you prefer to have on the project. Some people are really busy and a weekly email update is fine for them, and some love to see how their “child” is being created. We appreciate and respect both types of customers and adjust the process accordingly.V.   Quality Assurance and Delivery
